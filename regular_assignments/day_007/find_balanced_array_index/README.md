Problem Description
Given an array, arr[] of size N, the task is to find the count of array indices such that removing an element from these indices makes the sum of even-indexed and odd-indexed array elements equal.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
-105 <= A[i] <= 105
Sum of all elements of A <= 109

Input Format
First argument contains an array A of integers of size N

Output Format
Return the count of array indices such that removing an element from these indices makes the sum of even-indexed and odd-indexed array elements equal.

Example Input

Input 1:
A = [2, 1, 6, 4]

Input 2:
A = [1, 1, 1]

Example Output
Output 1:
1

Output 2:
3
